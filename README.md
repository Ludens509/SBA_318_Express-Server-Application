<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot]([])
This assessment measures your understanding of Node and Express and your capability to implement their features in a practical manner. You have creative freedom in the topic, material, and purpose of the web application you will be developing, so have fun with it! However, remember to plan the scope of your project to the timeline you have been given.

### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

- [HTML](#)
- [CSS](#)  
- [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)
- [NodeJS](https://ta.com/)

## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This application/site was created as a submission to a [SBA](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFtDB2xfOk/xEpMguB7x3VPSkrx3KaJgw/edit) challenge. The [challenge](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFtDB2xfOk/xEpMguB7x3VPSkrx3KaJgw/edit) was to build an application to create a small single-page web application.


## Acknowledgements

## Reflection

-What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?




-hat were difficult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects?




-What would you add to, or change about your application if given more time?




Use this space to make notes for your future self about anything that you think is important to remember about this process, or that may aid you when attempting something similar again.
